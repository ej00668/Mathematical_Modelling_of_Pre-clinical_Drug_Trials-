<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Abstract </h2>

The purpose of the current study is to establish a modelling framework to understand the movement of European badgers (Meles meles) within their environment. It is widely understood that badgers play a crucial role in the transmission of bovine tuberculosis (bTB), where bTB is a serious disease of cattle and has a significant economic impact on farmers. However, despite all the GPS data, ecologists still do not understand what they can learn from the data about fine-scale badger movement. A key research question we would like to answer is can we generate a dynamical model to explore badger movement?
 
To model the movements, we are using energy potentials, primarily seen in physics to describe particle motion. Such an approach has been successful in describing the movements of free-ranging elk and their avoidance of vehicles and humans but has yet to be applied to the study of badgers.
 
The model is created using data driven methods, where it is parametrized using GPS data. The modelling framework will allow us to answer key ecological questions: How does badger movement affect the spread of bTB? How does the weather affect badger movement? With the role badgers play in the spread of bTB, the answer to these questions could be crucial in the role of strategy planning.
 
We present results on the parameterized model with the data. This includes the generation of an energy potential and the estimation of a noise term. We have also analysed the differences between male and female badgers to understand different transitions. By simulating these differences, we have created a dynamical model that explores badger movement, and we can now start answering the key ecological questions.

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Generated Trajectory </h2>

Below is the animation linked to Figure 3, where the 'badger' can be seen to be moving along its trajectory. The initial position links to an individual badger that is being monitored at the park, and the diffusion term of the badger has been calculated. 

The animation is plotted every two iterations to show a smoother movement of the badger following its trajectory, in comparison to every thirty-five iterations in Figure 3. Also, only the first 10,000 iterations have been animated out of the 100,000 generated. But, this is a great tool to have a better visual of the badger movements in the park.
