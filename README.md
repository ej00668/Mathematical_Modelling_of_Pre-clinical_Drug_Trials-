<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Abstract </h2>

Translating findings from pre-clinical to clinical drug trials remains a significant challenge in pharmacology. The main issue is that most pre-clinical studies rely on mouse xenograft models, whereas clinical trials are conducted in humans, where tumours exhibit greater structural constraints and biological differences. A key step toward improving this translation is developing a robust mathematical understanding of pre-clinical trials outcomes, which can enhance predictive modelling, refine drug development strategies, and reduce reliance on animal models.
 
In this study, we analyse tumour growth data from patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models used in pre-clinical trials of small-molecule cytotoxic chemotherapy. The dataset (source: Novartis, open-source dataset) includes longitudinal tumour volume measurements across multiple cancer types capturing both untreated tumour growth and responses to various drug treatments. To characterise tumour growth dynamics, we fit non-linear mixed effects mechanistic tumour growth models for empirical growth laws that account for inter-tumour variability and treatment effects.
 
Beyond model fitting, we explore optimal dosing strategies for small-molecule drugs by integrating our models with RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours)-based response criteria, a set of guidelines used to assess the response of cancer patients to treatment for nutrient diffusion models. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of pre-clinical tumour growth patterns and provide a framework for improving dose optimisation, an important step in mathematical oncology. Longer term, this project, in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), aims to establish mechanistic modelling approaches incorporating spatial, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PKPD) effects to create models that are fit-for-use in drug development.

Below is the animation linked to Figure 3, where the 'badger' can be seen to be moving along its trajectory. The initial position links to an individual badger that is being monitored at the park, and the diffusion term of the badger has been calculated. 

The animation is plotted every two iterations to show a smoother movement of the badger following its trajectory, in comparison to every thirty-five iterations in Figure 3. Also, only the first 10,000 iterations have been animated out of the 100,000 generated. But, this is a great tool to have a better visual of the badger movements in the park.
